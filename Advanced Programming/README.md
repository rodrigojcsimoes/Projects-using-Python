# Advanced Programming

Documents from the course Advanced Programming, from Nova SBE, Business Analytics, where a study about the agricultural output of several countries was developed. The “project_agros” script contains all the code used in the Showcase notebook, with its own documentation. All the project findings can be found in the Showcase notebook, where the methods’ outputs are used to draw conclusions on the data provided, at a worldwide level, and especially focused on Portugal, Mexico and China.
